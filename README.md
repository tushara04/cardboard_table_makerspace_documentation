# Cardboard Table Documentation

## Project Description
The project involved designing and building a table purely out of cardboard, using only a provided documentation for reference and some stationery. The goal was to understand the basic principles and thought process that go into building something and practice the problem solving and critical and creative thinking muscles. The table had to be functional and of at least 90x60x53 cm in dimensions. It was expected to be freestanding and stable, capable of holding at least 3-5 kg of mass and with enough gap between the legs for a 3D printing spool of dimensions 20x6 cm to roll in one axis.

## Materials Used
1. Carboard
2. A4 sheets
3. Paper cutter and cutting mat
4. Pen and rulers

## Ideas foundational to the design.
To allow for stability, the table had to be designed with direct load paths for the force to travel down the structure to the ground. If there are any weak points in the paths, the structure could crumble under its weight. A good design would ensure a well distribution of weight, for which it is essential to identify the table's center of gravity that naturally allows for weight distribution in all directions and thus a proper flow of force. Symmetric designs make this easier. 

Additionally, due to the nature of cardboard, it is stronger under compression, which is especially true for its edges since the cardboard fibres have strong resistance against force applied perpendicular to the grains flowing perpendicular to the edges. 

These ideas were key to my design, which led to its success in terms of holding 15.7 kg of weight.

## Design Process
### Brainstorming the design
1. Keeping the ideas discussed above in mind, I realized it would be best to have the table top such that the weights are placed on the edges of the cardboard. This would ensure the top is strong. So, I decided to have an array of vertically placed cardboard pieces interlocked perpendicularly with another set of similar, but longer in length and smaller in height, cardboard pieces. 
2. The shape should be symmetric, and cutting the cardboard in circle would have been a challenge, so I went with a rectangle.
3. I decided to go with 4 legs for the four vertices of the rectangular top. They should be placed such that the edges of the cardboard are holding onto the table top, to ensure structural integrity. But, given that the cardboards had some areas damaged, going with a single long piece would introduce weak points that could disrupt the load path. Instead, I decided to design multiple cubes staked on top of and interlocked with each other.

### Designing a prototype
1. I first measured the dimensions of the 3D spool and planned the dimensions of my table. Given the table had to be at least 53 cm in height and the spool was 20 cm long, I was left with 33 cm that I had to cover.
2. Each of the vertical cardboard piece in the array had 0.2 cm of width. So, to cover 90 cm length of the table, I needed maximum of 450 pieces, which wasn't practical. So, I decided to go with 10 pieces instead, with about 10 cm of gap between each piece placed parallel to each other. I made them to be 60 cm in length, to meet the width requirement of the table, and 25 cm in height so that the cardboards are long enough to withhold immense pressure put on by the weights placed above. This way I'd be left with 8 cm gap between the spool and the bottom surface of the table top.
3. I then cut 11 more pieces of cardboard of 90 cm length and 10 cm height. These were put inside the 25 cm long carboards, at intervals of 5 cm from each side, leaving me with 15 cm underneath for the legs. To put them inside, I made 11 cuts of 10x0.2cm vertically downwards with 5 cm gap from the sides and in between. The table top was ready.

> **I later realized that this was not the best idea since while it allowed the pieces go inside easily, cutting them took time, damaged the cardboard, introduced instability, and was wide enough for the 0.2 cm wide carboards put inside to come out as well. A single cut of 10 cm long without any additional width would have ensured they are interlocked relatively more strongly and do not get damaged and are stable, which is what I did when designing the legs.**

4. To design the legs, I cut 40x65 cm square of cardboard. 5 cm of the 40 cm length went into the cuts made in the lower layer of the two cardboard pieces in each side of the table top to interlock the legs with the top. The remaining 35 cm added height to the table. The square plane was folded to make a cuboid of 15 cm side length. The remaining 5 cm was used to layer up a side and make a cut to put a piece of cardboard inside that would interlock the cube into its shape. Each corner of the table had a cuboidal leg. And the table was ready.

> **My initial plan was to make multiple smaller cubes of 5-10 cm length stacked on top of each other. But at that time I couldn't figure out how to merge two cubes together. I had thought on rotating one cube by 45 degrees with respect to the one below it and make a cut to put them inside, but doing this was challenging and damaged the cubes. To save time, I decided to go with the single cuboid. Later I discovered that I could have made a cut in both cubes and put a cardboard piece in between that would have merged the two.**

### The final design
The final design was not what I had hoped it to be. It was unstable, uneven, and asymmetric. However, it was capable of withstanding 15.7 kg of weight and have the spool roll under.

After that, the table crumbed under the weight and was damaged.

As I had expected, the table fell on the side where the arrays of carboard pieces were weak and unstable. Since I used the same cardboard pieces to make the cuboidal legs that I had used to try an earlier version of triangular legs, the legs had gotten weaker due to all the folding. Moreoever, to interlock the leg with the lower layer of the table top, I had to make a cut. But due to imprecise measurements, the cuts were misaligned initial, due to which I had to make more cuts, which left the interlocks weaker too. All these contributed to the table's fall.

### Challenges faced and things to do differently
1. The build took more time than allocated. I was expected to finish it in 2-3 hours but it took me about 5 hours. That is because of the many components of the table that had to be cut and brought together. Moreoever, I spent some time designing a smaller version of my table to test the idea (it seemed to have worked surprisingly well there). I did read the documentation thoroughly though, which while it took time, helped me well while brainstorming.

2. It was challenging to cut the cardboard perfectly as the planned dimensions. Due to parallax effect, I could not make straight lines or straight cuts, so to deal with that I had to make marks in multiple points using which the ruler was aligned. There were still some misalignments. Moreoever, when cutting the cardboard, the top layer won't stop getting sheared, damaging its integrity and affecting the dimensions of the cuts. To deal with that I made the first cut very light and then made multiple cuts on top.

3. A single cut of blade on a piece of cardboard and pushing other pieces inside proved to better in terms of ensuring a greater structural integrity, but it wasn't until I was designing the legs that I discovered this. The top was hence unstable.

4. After I realized I couldn't make smaller cubes stacked on top of each other for legs, I thought of having triangular bases instead of square, which I designed. But merging this with the lower layer of the surface top proved challenging since I hadn't discovered the two-cut-cardboard-in-between way of merging pieces by then.

If I had more time, I would have ensured the cuts are perfect and the placements of the legs and the pieces are symmetric for good distribution of weight. Either way, it was extremely fun to design something purely out of what I already knew and what the documentation suggested. I am glad to have come up with the design of the table top which proved to be much stronger than I had expected.
