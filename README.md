# Cardboard Table Documentation

## Project Description
The project involved designing and building a table purely out of cardboard, using only a provided documentation for reference and some stationery. The goal was to understand the basic principles and thought process that go into building something and practice the problem solving and critical and creative thinking muscles. The table had to be functional and of at least 90x60x53 cm in dimensions. It was expected to be freestanding and stable, capable of holding at least 3-5 kg of mass and with enough gap between the legs for a 3D printing spool of dimensions 20x6 cm to roll in one axis.

## Materials Used
1. Carboard
2. A4 sheets
3. Paper cutter and cutting mat
4. Pen and rulers

## Ideas foundational to the design.
To allow for stability, the table had to be designed with direct load paths for the force to travel down the structure to the ground. If there are any weak points in the paths, the structure could crumble under its weight. A good design would ensure a well distribution of weight, for which it is essential to identify the table's center of gravity that naturally allows for weight distribution in all directions and thus a proper flow of force. Symmetric designs make this easier. 

Additionally, due to the nature of cardboard, it is stronger under compression, which is especially true for its edges since the cardboard fibres have strong resistance against force applied perpendicular to the grains flowing perpendicular to the edges. 

These ideas were key to my design, which led to its success in terms of holding 15.7 kg of weight.

## Design Process
### Brainstorming the design
1. Keeping the ideas discussed above in mind, I realized it would be best to have the table top such that the weights are placed on the edges of the cardboard. This would ensure the top is strong. So, I decided to have an array of vertically placed cardboard pieces interlocked perpendicularly with another set of similar, but longer in length and smaller in height, cardboard pieces. 
2. The shape should be symmetric, and cutting the cardboard in circle would have been a challenge, so I went with a rectangle.
3. I decided to go with 4 legs for the four vertices of the rectangular top. They should be placed such that the edges of the cardboard are holding onto the table top, to ensure structural integrity. But, given that the cardboards had some areas damaged, going with a single long piece would introduce weak points that could disrupt the load path. Instead, I decided to design multiple cubes staked on top of and interlocked with each other.

### Designing a prototype
1. I first measured the dimensions of the 
maintained the dimensional ratio and designed the prototype.

### Designing the table

So, I decided to take pieces of cardboard and place them in an array. This set of cardboard pieces were of 60 cm in length and 25 cm in height. 60 cm to meet the requirement and 25 cm so that they are long enough to withold immense pressure put on by the weights to be placed above. The whole table had to be of at least 53 cm in height, and the 3D printing spool to be rolled down was 20 cm in height, so I had at least 33 cm. I decided to keep 8 cm as buffer length. On top of these 

challenges faced: 
1. took more than the allocated 2-3 hrs to build -- mainly because i didn't start with building right away but spent much time thinking through, designing a simple prototype, and coming up with ideas without any regards for time. 

the ideas that i had in my mind but i wasn't able to execute. 

the dimensions of the build -- and why i think those were set as the restrictions.

2. cutting was a pain in the ass -- plus my eyes are fucked in the sense they are not able to tell if a ruler is straight. so there were misalignments in cutting -- but to fix the issue i did make marks at multiple spots that aided in cutting. The problem also was that it was cardboard that i was cutting -- so the top layer was get shears. 

3. when joining two sides - i had initial thought cutting 0.2 cm wide gaps would allow for other structures to get in, but i was wrong since it also meant they could come out easily. Later i discovered a single cut of blade and forcing down the cardboard ensured a greater structural integrity since the cardboards were thereby locked in to come out on its own. 

Doing this for the surface top would have ensured a greater structure integrity, which i failed at doing due to late realization. 

triangulation is stronger since they cant change form without having their side lengths changed. but i stuck with square because i found it harder to merge two pieces together.
