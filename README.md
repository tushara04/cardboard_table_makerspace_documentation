# Cardboard Table Documentation

## Project Description
The project involved designing and building a table purely out of cardboard, using only a provided documentation for reference and some stationery. The goal was to understand the basic principles and thought process that go into building something and practice the problem solving and critical and creative thinking muscles. 

## Materials Used
1. Carboard
2. A4 sheets
3. Paper cutter and cutting mat
4. Pen and rulers

## Construction  

challenges faced: 
1. took more than the allocated 2-3 hrs to build -- mainly because i didn't start with building right away but spent much time thinking through, designing a simple prototype, and coming up with ideas without any regards for time. 

the ideas that i had in my mind but i wasn't able to execute. 

the dimensions of the build -- and why i think those were set as the restrictions.

2. cutting was a pain in the ass -- plus my eyes are fucked in the sense they are not able to tell if a ruler is straight. so there were misalignments in cutting -- but to fix the issue i did make marks at multiple spots that aided in cutting. The problem also was that it was cardboard that i was cutting -- so the top layer was get shears.
